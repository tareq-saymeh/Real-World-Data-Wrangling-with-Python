# Real-World Data Wrangling with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on performing real-world data wrangling tasks using Python. The main objective is to clean, transform, and enrich a raw dataset to prepare it for analysis. The project follows the standard data wrangling process, including data gathering, assessing data quality, and applying the necessary cleaning techniques.

## Project Structure
- **Data Gathering**: The dataset is obtained from various sources (e.g., CSV files, APIs).
- **Data Assessing**: The gathered data is assessed for quality and tidiness issues through both visual inspection and programmatic checks.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identified data issues are addressed using Python, with steps including handling missing data, correcting data types, and dealing with inconsistencies.



## Usage
The notebook guides you through the data wrangling process step-by-step. It begins with data gathering, followed by data assessing where you can see the identified quality and tidiness issues. Finally, it implements the necessary cleaning operations to prepare the dataset for further analysis or visualization.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas 
- NumPy 
- Jupyter Notebook 

## Key Steps in Data Wrangling
- **Data Gathering**: Loading datasets from various sources (e.g., CSV files, JSON files, APIs).
- **Data Assessing**: Identifying issues in the dataset, such as missing values, incorrect data types, or inconsistencies.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implementing solutions to address the identified issues, such as:
  - Handling missing data.
  - Converting data types.
  - Standardizing formats and categories.
